I am an electrical engineering student at CSUF and I expect to graduate in 2026. 

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs 
* Lab 2, Part 1 
This was one of my favorite labs that we did because it taught me the fundamentals of line wrapping and compiling. I thoroughly enjoyed the madlib program that we created and found it fun to input different singular noun for the first word, a plural noun for the second word and a present tense verb for the third word. It was satisfying to successfully compile the code and run the program.

* Lab 8, Part 1 
This was also another favorite lab because it required a program that involves a function that computes the average mean of all elements of a vector except the minimum and maximum. It was interesting how the program eliminated the highest and lowest score and found the average the three middle scores. It was also satisfying successfully compiling the code and running the program.

* Lab 10, Part 1 
This was another favorite lab because I learned about how to create a two dimensional data structure to organize California’s population data by county. I liked how the program is able to search through the vector and report the population of a given county along with the percentage of the state’s population lives in that county. Learning the fundamentals of this program made me realize all the different possibilities of vectors that you could search through.
